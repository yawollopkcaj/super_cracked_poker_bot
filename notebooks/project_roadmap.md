# Project Roadmap: Super Duper Cracked Poker Bot

---

## Milestone 0 – Setup & Foundations *(Week 1)*
**Establish basic structure and dev environment**
- [x] Set up GitHub repo and README  
- [x] Install PokerRL or OpenSpiel  
- [x] Define modular architecture (agent, environment, model, utils)  
- [x] Create CLI or notebook-based testbed  
- [x] Collect sample logs from online play or self-play  
- [x] Write baseline rule-based bot for benchmarking  

---

## Milestone 1 – Bayesian Opponent Modeling *(Weeks 2–4)*
**Build and test initial opponent modeling engine**
- [ ] Implement Dirichlet-multinomial model to track action frequencies  
- [ ] Add logistic regression model to predict folds/bluffs  
- [ ] Build data pipeline to update beliefs during play  
- [ ] Evaluate model accuracy on labeled hand data  
- [ ] Add visualization of real-time opponent tendencies (CLI or browser)  

*Stretch:* Incorporate HMM to infer hidden states (e.g., loose/tight)

---

## Milestone 2 – Strategic Response Engine *(Weeks 4–6)*
**Train your bot to respond based on modeled opponent behavior**
- [ ] Implement Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) on abstract game  
- [ ] Train bot vs baseline opponent for exploitability testing  
- [ ] Design simple abstraction (e.g., hand buckets)  
- [ ] Integrate real-time exploit strategy using Bayesian updates  
- [ ] Begin testing in 3–6 player games with static opponents  

*Stretch:* Analyze exploitability gaps vs GTO-like opponents

---

## Milestone 3 – Reinforcement Learning Agent *(Weeks 6–9)*
**Build an RL-based poker player that adapts and learns**
- [ ] Implement DQN or PPO agent using simplified environment  
- [ ] Define reward shaping (e.g., pot odds, expected value)  
- [ ] Train against random and rule-based bots  
- [ ] Track convergence and key metrics (win rate, regret)  
- [ ] Start experimenting with combining RL + opponent model  

*Stretch:* Use transformer or RNN-based architecture for action prediction

---

## Milestone 4 – Real-Time Adaptation & Meta-Learning *(Weeks 9–11)*
**Give the bot in-game flexibility and rapid opponent adjustment**
- [ ] Implement contextual bandit or meta-learned exploration  
- [ ] Evaluate how fast the bot adapts to bluff-heavy or tight players  
- [ ] Tune thresholding logic for switching strategies  
- [ ] Measure gains vs static policy bots in 1000+ hands  

*Stretch:* Try MAML for fast adaptation across player archetypes

---

## Milestone 5 – Public Interface & Visualization *(Weeks 11–13)*
**Make the project more accessible, testable, and shareable**
- [ ] Develop web-based or CLI-based interface to play against the bot  
- [ ] Add visual opponent model (bluff %, aggression heatmaps)  
- [ ] Integrate logging and replay viewer  
- [ ] Launch interactive demo or screencast  
- [ ] Write beginner-friendly blog post about the math + engineering  

---

## Final Deliverables *(Week 14+)*
- [ ] Modular, commented codebase with unit tests  
- [ ] Blog post(s), demo video(s), and clear documentation  
- [ ] Public benchmark suite (win rate, exploitability, adaptation rate)  
- [ ] Optional: Submission to GitHub Projects, ArXiv, or Hacker News post
